# MibPackageExtractor

A tool to extract all the files from a .mib package file. Some PC games use the .mib package format. I wrote this tool to be able to read the contents of the game Senran Kagura: Bon Appetit.

This tool is still very early, as it can't read many of the .mib file formats. Some .mib files have their contents encrypted or compressed of unknown type.

Set in the code the path to your .mib file, and the folder where to output the contents.

To be continued.
